# Chessable HR App Task

>You should write a simple HR app. There should be departments with names and employees with names and salaries. As a minimum it should be possible to add departments and employees, and to run the following reports:

1. Show all departments along with the highest salary within each department. A department with no employees should show 0 as the highest salary.

2. List just those departments that have more than two employees that earn over 50k.
